A customizable JQuery content slider with CSS3 animations and parallax effects.

== Description ==

WP Parallax Content Slider is a plugin which adds automatically a content slider of your last posts where you want on your Wordpress blog or website.

This plugin is written upon the code of [Manoella Ilic](http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/crnacura/), you can see the simple JQuery and CSS version [here](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/15/parallax-content-slider-with-css3-and-jquery/).

Transitions between slides are made using a powerfull combination of CSS3 and JQuery to display a beautiful parallax effect.

It is very easy to configure the plugin as it adds automatically an admin page in Wordpress administration section. You will be able to configure :

* The number of posts to display ;
* The auto-switch mode ;
* The time between each slide ;
* The sort order of the posts to display ;
* The graphic theme ;
* and many more...

It's also possible to choose to display a static HTML content instead of displaying last posts in the slider.

New in v0.7: Choose between 4 CSS color themes!

== Installation ==

To install the plugin you must follow these 4 simple steps:

1. Upload the `wp-parallax-content-slider` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

1. Customize your slider with the option panel in Wordpress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add/edit slides in static mode? =

In static display mode, the plugin simply use the 4 slides which are in the file `static-slides-sample.php`. So if you want to add/edit slides, youâ€™ll have to edit manually this file! (I recommand to copy the sample file and rename it, then change the inclusion in `wp-parallax-content-slider.php`:
`include('static-slides-sample.php');`
to
`include('static-slides-customized.php');`

= Why can I see the parallax effect in Internet Explorer? =

Unfortunately for IE users, this slider use CSS3 transitions & animations which are not yet supported by IE :(

[http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions)
[http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-animation)

So the slider will works, but without the parallax effect!
